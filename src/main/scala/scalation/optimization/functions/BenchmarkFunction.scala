// Trait.
/** The `BenchmarkFunction` trait specifies the requirements for the logic
 *  of an object representing a benchmark function. The methods provided in this
 *  trait are used for tests and benchmarks performed on function optimization
 *  and gradient descent classes.
 *
 *  Classes mixing in this trait must declare the `functionMinimum` field and
 *  implement the `objectiveFunction` method. Additionally, overriding the
 *  default implementation of the `gradientFunction` method is highly
 *  recommended. The `objectiveFunction` method represents the mathematical
 *  function the object will model. The `functionMinimum` field represents the
 *  variable values that minimize the output of the `objectiveFunction` method.
 *  Finally, the `gradientFunction` method represents the gradient function for
 *  the `objectiveFunction` function. An approximation for this method is
 *  automatically provided by making use of the [[Differential]] class, but
 *  overriding it with a hard-coded definition of the gradient function is
 *  highly recommended as it will greatly improve the accuracy of the results.
