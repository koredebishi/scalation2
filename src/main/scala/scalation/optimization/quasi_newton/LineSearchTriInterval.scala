/** The `LineSearchTriInterval` case class represents a trial interval for
 *  determining an optimal step, including the next step that should be
 *  evaluated based on the current endpoints of the trial interval.  This class
 *  is used by the line search algorithm when attempting to minimize the
 *  objective function.  In each iteration of the line search algorithm, the
 *  trial interval will be updated until certain conditions are met that result
 *  in a line search step being selected.
 *
 *  @param x       Value of the endpoint in the step trial interval that yields
 *                 the least function value at the moment.
 *  @param fx      Objective function value obtained by using step `x`.
 *  @param dx      Derivative of the objective function obtained by using step `x`.
 *  @param y       Value of the second endpoint in the step trial interval (the
 *                 first endpoint being `x`).
 *  @param fy      Objective function value obtained by using step `y`.
 *  @param dy      Derivative of the objective function obtained by using step `y`.
 *  @param t       The new step chosen to be evaluated in an iteration of the
 *                 line search algorithm based on the trial interval information.
 *  @param brackt  Indicates if the trial value `t` is bracketed. If set to
 *                 true, the minimizer has been bracketed in an interval of
 *                 uncertainty with endpoints between `x` and `y`.
